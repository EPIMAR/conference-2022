10h / Real Life Epigenetics – A Multiple Angles Approach
Adrian-Kalchhauser, Irene. Dr. Adrian-Kalchhauser investigates the role of epigenetics for the fitness, plasticity, and adaptation of vertebrates in changing environments. She combines her molecular biology education with ecology and evolution to understand how wild vertebrates store and inherit environmental exposures and experiences. She combines basic and applied approaches in her research, and tries to understand fundamental mechanisms of biology on the one hand and applications as markers for disease, environmental change or pollution on the other hand.

Rodriguez-Casariego, Javier. Dr. Rodriguez-Casariego completed his Bachelors and Master degree in Marine Biology at the University of Havana (Cuba). In 2012, he joined the Ecotoxicology and Risk Assessment Lab at FIU, integrating ecological, physiological and molecular data to study organism’s responses to environmental stress. In 2016, he joined the Environmental Epigenetics Lab (EELab) as a Ph.D. student, studying how epigenetic mechanisms modulate responses to environmental stress in “key marine organisms” – those capable of creating and maintaining ecosystems – which are critically impacted by global climate change.

Trigg, Shelly. Shelly began as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Steven Roberts’ lab in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at University of Washington where she studied how the environment impacts marine animals at the physiological and molecular systems level. She conducted experiments that simulated various ocean conditions and used omics technologies (like epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) in combination with physiological assays to measure animal response. In March of 2021, Shelly started her current position as a Research Scientist at Gloucester Marine Genomics Institute.
